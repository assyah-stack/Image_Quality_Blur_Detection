# Image_Quality_Blur_Detection

This is an image classification project that predicts whether an image is **blurry**, **original**, or **sharp**.  
It was created following a tutorial on Dataquest and with guidance from ChatGPT. 


##  Project Steps

1. Set up the project and Loaded the Data 
3. Explored Images in the Data 
4. Trainined an Initial Convolutional Layer 
5. Looked at the Model Error 
6. Improved the Model Accuracy 
7. Augmented the Data 
8. Investigated the Model Error

   
## How to Run

Open Image_Quality_Blur_Classification.ipynb in Google Colab.
Mount Google Drive for dataset and result storage.
Run all cells sequentially.
View results and plots in the notebook or in the results/ folder.


## Requirements/Dependencies
- Python 3.8+  
- TensorFlow  
- OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- NumPy  
- Pandas
